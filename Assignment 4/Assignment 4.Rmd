#Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. 
#Justify the various choices #made in conducting the cluster analysis, 
#such as weights for different variables, the specific 
#clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of clusters formed, and so on.

#CLuster 1:- JNJ, MRK, GSK, PFE

#The above graphs indicate that there is a slim pattern in the clusters.

#Although the cluster 1 has a different Hold and Moderate Buy median, a 
#different count from the US and Germany, and a different country count, 
#the firms are evenly divided among AMEX,NASDAQ and NYSE.

#The cluster 2 is only listed on the NYSE, has equal Hold and Moderate Buy 
#medians, and is evenly divided across the US and Canada.

#The Cluster 3 is listed on the NYSE and has equal Moderate Buy and Sell 
#medians as well as a separate count from France, Ireland, and the US.

#The Hold median in Cluster 4 is the highest, followed by Moderate Buy, 
#Strong Buy, and Hold medians. They come from the US, the UK, and Switzerland, 
#and they are listed on the NYSE.

#The Cluster 5 is scattered throughout the US and the UK, has the same hold 
#and moderate buy medians, and is likewise listed on the NYSE.

#TASK 4
#Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset. 

#Cluster 1 :- Buy Cluster
#Cluster 2 :- Sceptical Cluster
#Cluster 3 :- Moderate Buy Cluster
#Cluster 4 :- Hold Cluster
#Cluster 5 :- High Hold Cluster
